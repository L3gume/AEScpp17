# AEScpp17

### This is just me experimenting with some C++11-17 features while implementing the AES algorithm.

TODO:  
* Create simple command line interface.
* Create a constexpr dictionnary of command help text for the CLI.
* Implement support for the 196 and 256 bit versions of the cipher.
* Make sure the encryption/decryption process doesn't affect the intergrity of the files so that any type of file can be encrypted.
* Create GUI using Qt5 (maybe?)

*As I said, this is basically an experiment, expect suboptimal and/or pointless code, like that lambda I used :D*
